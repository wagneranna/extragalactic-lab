    "We would like to have some radio sources for which the radio emission can be analyzed together with SDSS spectra (e.g. to determine the redshift and to assess which AGN type it is). For many radio sources no SDSS are available and, vice versa, many AGN with SDSS spectra do not show radio emission. To find sources with both information we can show SDSS sources with spectra as regions in ds9.\n",
